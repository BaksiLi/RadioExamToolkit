T0C06|Which of the following is an acceptable method to determine that your station complies with FCC RF exposure regulations?|D|||By calculation based on computer modeling|By measurement of field strength using calibrated equipment|By calculation based on FCC OET Bulletin 65|All of these choices are correct
T0C07|What could happen if a person accidentally touched your antenna while you were transmitting?|A|||They might receive a painful RF burn|Touching the antenna could cause television interference|They might develop radiation poisoning|All of these choices are correct
T0C08|Which of the following actions might amateur operators take to prevent exposure to RF radiation in excess of FCC-supplied limits?|B|||Increase the duty cycle|Relocate antennas|Relocate the transmitter|All of these choices are correct
T0C09|How can you make sure your station stays in compliance with RF safety regulations?|A|||By re-evaluating the station whenever an item of equipment is changed|By making sure your antennas have low SWR|By informing the FCC of any changes made in your station|All of these choices are correct
T0C10|Why is duty cycle one of the factors used to determine safe RF radiation exposure levels?|A|||It affects the average exposure of people to radiation|It affects the peak exposure of people to radiation|It takes into account the thermal effects of the final amplifier|It takes into account the antenna feed line loss
T0C11|What is the definition of duty cycle during the averaging time for RF exposure?|D|||The difference between the lowest power output and the highest power output of a transmitter|The difference between the PEP and average power output of a transmitter|The percentage of time that a transmitter is not transmitting|The percentage of time that a transmitter is transmitting
T0C12|How does RF radiation differ from ionizing radiation (radioactivity)?|A|||RF radiation does not have sufficient energy to cause genetic damage|RF radiation is perfectly safe|RF radiation can only be detected with an RF dosimeter|RF radiation is limited in range to a few feet
T0C13|If the averaging time for exposure is 6 minutes, how much power density is permitted if the signal is present for 3 minutes and absent for 3 minutes rather than being present for the entire 6 minutes?|A|||2 times as much|1/2 as much|There is no adjustment allowed for shorter exposure times|3 times as much
